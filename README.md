## Hybrid Gating demo

Myeloid cell frequencies predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
Since we found higher frequencies of myeloid cells in anti-PD-1 therapy responders
before therapy (Figure 1E), we interrogated a third myeloid centric panel
(Supplementary Figure 5). FlowSOM was used to separate 7 subpopulations, which
were annotated as T cells, B cells, NK cells, CD14+
(CD11b+HLA-DRhi) myeloid cells,
CD14-
(CD11b+HLA-DRlo) myeloid cells, classical CD1c+CD11c+HLA-DR+
 dendritic
cells cDC, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD123+CD303+HLA-DR+CD11c-
 pDC). 
 
### Hybrid gating gets the best of both worlds

* Approach combining both methods
* Manual gating interface
* No-code platform
* Scalability

### How does it improve manual gating?
 
* No arbitrary threshold
* Reproducible results based on a data-driven model

### How does it improve automated gating?

* Integration of prior biological knowledge
* Fine reference (intermediate values)
