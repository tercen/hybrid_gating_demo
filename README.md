__Tercen Team__

## Introduction

* Tercen is a __biomedical data analysis platform__ designed to perform flexible analyses of scientific data in a __no-code__ environment.
* We provide a way to build analysis __workflows__ by combining __building blocks__ (operators and apps) performing __computation__ or producing __charts__.
* The goal is to create __reproducible__, __reusable__ and __scalable__ workflows as dataset sizes increase.

## Data and scientific context

We have CyTOF data for two donor groups: __responders__ and __non-responders__, PBMC at baseline. Our goal for today is to answer the following questions:

**- Do we observe differences in cell proportions among groups (responders, non-responders)?**


## Manual Gating pros and cons

## Automated Gating pros and cons

## Hybrid Gating

* Approach combining both methods
* Manual gating interface
* No-code platform
* Scalability

### How does Hybrid Gating improve manual gating?

__Manual Gating: workflow 1. Pros and cons.__

* No arbitrary threshold
* Reproducible results based on a data-driven model

### How does Hybrid Gating improve automated gating?

__Auto Gating: workflow 2. Pros and cons.__

* Integration of prior biological knowledge
* Fine reference (intermediate values)

## From Raw Data to Report

* Workflow 4
* Reporting example, R vs. NR barplots
* Powerpoint export
